2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase delivers working, valuable features
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Address technical challenges early (graph performance, data sync, flexible schemas)
4. **User Feedback**: Early access for stakeholders to provide input
5. **Technical Foundation**: Build robust architecture that supports future phases

### Team Allocation
- **Total Team**: 20 developers (6 Frontend, 8 Backend, 3 DevOps, 3 QA)
- **Phase Focus**: Team members will shift focus between phases based on priorities
